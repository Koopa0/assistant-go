# Assistant

An intelligent development companion that evolves with you. Assistant transcends traditional development tools by understanding your context, learning from your patterns, and actively participating in your development workflow. Built with Go's simplicity and performance, it demonstrates how AI can meaningfully enhance software development without adding complexity.

## Beyond Traditional Tools

Imagine a development assistant that not only executes your commands but understands your intent, remembers your preferences, and anticipates your needs. Assistant represents a fundamental shift in how we interact with development tools, transforming isolated utilities into an intelligent, cohesive system that grows more valuable with every interaction.

When you're debugging a production issue at 2 AM, Assistant doesn't just run queries or check logs—it understands the urgency, recalls similar past incidents, coordinates multiple diagnostic tools, and synthesizes findings into actionable insights. It's like having a senior developer who knows your entire codebase, understands your architecture, and never forgets a lesson learned.

## Core Capabilities

### Intelligent Orchestration

Assistant employs a sophisticated agent network where specialized AI agents collaborate to solve complex problems. Unlike traditional tools that require you to coordinate different utilities manually, Assistant understands your goal and orchestrates the right combination of tools and expertise automatically.

For example, when you mention "my API is slow," Assistant might simultaneously analyze database queries, examine container resource usage, profile application code, and check recent deployments—synthesizing all findings into a cohesive diagnosis with specific recommendations.

### Contextual Awareness

Every interaction happens within a rich context that Assistant actively maintains. It understands not just your current command but your entire development environment—which files you're working on, recent changes you've made, the structure of your projects, and patterns in your workflow.

This contextual awareness enables remarkably intelligent assistance. When you're writing a database migration, Assistant can warn you about potential impacts on existing queries it's seen you use frequently. When debugging, it can connect seemingly unrelated changes to current issues based on your project's history.

### Continuous Learning

Assistant learns from every interaction, building a personalized model of your development style, preferences, and patterns. This isn't just command history—it's a deep understanding of how you work, what you value, and what challenges you frequently face.

The learning system recognizes patterns like your debugging approaches, code organization preferences, and common workflows. Over time, it can automate repetitive tasks, suggest optimizations based on your specific patterns, and even predict issues before they occur based on similar past situations.

### Collaborative Intelligence

Tools in Assistant don't operate in isolation—they share intelligence and collaborate to achieve your goals. When the SQL tool optimizes a query, it can inform the Kubernetes tool about expected resource changes. When the code analyzer detects a pattern, it can guide the refactoring tool's suggestions.

This collaboration extends to working with you. Assistant explains its reasoning, shows its confidence levels, and can engage in dialogue to refine its understanding of complex problems. It's designed to augment your intelligence, not replace it.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Assistant requires minimal setup while delivering maximal intelligence. You'll need:

- Go 1.24 or higher (for the latest standard library enhancements)
- PostgreSQL 15+ with pgvector extension (for intelligent memory)
- 8GB RAM recommended (4GB minimum)
- 10GB disk space for knowledge bases and learning data

Optional integrations enhance specific capabilities:
- Docker for container management features
- Kubernetes cluster access for K8s features
- Cloud provider credentials for deployment automation

### Installation

```bash
# Install via Go
go install github.com/yourusername/assistant/cmd/assistant@latest

# Or download pre-built binary
curl -sSL https://assistant.dev/install.sh | bash

# Initialize your personal assistant
assistant init

# This creates ~/.assistant/ with:
# - Personal knowledge base
# - Learning models
# - Secure credential storage
# - Configuration templates
```

### First Interaction

Your first interaction with Assistant sets the tone for your relationship with your new development companion:

```bash
# Start an intelligent conversation
assistant chat

> Hello! I'm Assistant, your intelligent development companion. 
> I'm here to help with your development workflow and learn from 
> your patterns to provide increasingly personalized assistance.
>
> To get started, I'd like to understand your development context.
> What are you currently working on?

# Share your context
> I'm working on a microservices application with Go, using PostgreSQL 
> and deploying to Kubernetes. Lately, I've been dealing with 
> performance issues in our API endpoints.

> I understand. I'll help you investigate those performance issues 
> systematically. I can analyze your code, examine database queries, 
> check Kubernetes resource allocation, and synthesize findings.
>
> Would you like me to start by analyzing your recent API endpoints
> for common performance patterns?
```

### Practical Examples

#### Intelligent Debugging

When investigating issues, Assistant coordinates multiple tools and synthesizes findings:

```bash
# Natural language problem description
assistant investigate "users are reporting timeout errors on the checkout endpoint"

# Assistant responds:
> Investigating timeout issues on checkout endpoint...
> 
> ✓ Analyzing recent deployments... found changes 3 hours ago
> ✓ Examining database queries... detected slow query pattern
> ✓ Checking Kubernetes metrics... CPU usage normal, memory growing
> ✓ Reviewing error logs... connection pool exhaustion warnings
>
> Root Cause Analysis:
> The timeout issues appear to be caused by a database connection leak
> introduced in commit a3f2d1c. The new checkout validation adds a 
> database call inside a loop without proper connection handling.
>
> Immediate remediation:
> 1. Increase connection pool size (temporary fix)
> 2. Restart affected pods to clear leaked connections
>
> Permanent solution:
> I've prepared a fix that properly handles connections. Would you
> like me to show you the code changes?
```

#### Proactive Assistance

Assistant learns your patterns and provides proactive help:

```bash
# Working on a new feature
assistant code --watch

# As you write code, Assistant provides contextual assistance:
> I notice you're implementing a caching layer similar to the one
> in the user service. Consider using the pattern from commit b4e5f2a
> which handles cache invalidation more efficiently.
>
> Also, based on your typical load patterns, you might want to
> implement cache warming for frequently accessed items.
```

#### Complex Refactoring

For sophisticated code transformations, Assistant understands intent and maintains consistency:

```bash
# Describe the refactoring goal
assistant refactor "convert our payment service to use event sourcing"

# Assistant creates a comprehensive plan:
> Refactoring payment service to event sourcing pattern...
>
> Analysis complete. This refactoring will:
> - Affect 23 files across 3 packages
> - Require 4 new event types
> - Need migration strategy for existing data
> - Impact 2 dependent services
>
> I've prepared a step-by-step plan that maintains backward
> compatibility. The refactoring can be done in 3 phases:
>
> Phase 1: Introduce event store alongside current state
> Phase 2: Migrate write operations to use events  
> Phase 3: Transition read models and deprecate old storage
>
> Would you like me to start with Phase 1?
```

## Advanced Features

### Personal Knowledge Graph

Assistant builds a comprehensive understanding of your development universe. This isn't just file indexing—it's a semantic understanding of your projects, their relationships, and their evolution over time.

```bash
# Query your personal knowledge
assistant knowledge query "what patterns do I commonly use for API authentication?"

# Assistant responds with personalized insights:
> Based on analysis of your 12 projects, you typically use:
>
> 1. JWT tokens with refresh rotation (8 projects)
>    - Average token lifetime: 15 minutes
>    - Refresh token in HTTP-only cookies
>    - Custom claims for role-based access
>
> 2. API keys for service-to-service (4 projects)
>    - HMAC-based request signing
>    - Key rotation every 90 days
>
> I notice you've been exploring OAuth2 in your recent work.
> Would you like me to suggest how to integrate it with your
> existing patterns?
```

### Intelligent Automation

Assistant can automate complex workflows while maintaining your specific practices and preferences:

```bash
# Define an intelligent automation
assistant automate "setup new microservice with our standard patterns"

# Assistant creates a tailored automation:
> I'll create an automation based on your typical microservice setup:
>
> 1. Project structure matching your conventions
> 2. Standard libraries you use (gin, pgx, zap)
> 3. Your preferred error handling patterns
> 4. CI/CD pipeline based on your Jenkins templates
> 5. Kubernetes manifests with your labeling scheme
> 6. README format you consistently use
>
> I've noticed you always add health checks and metrics endpoints.
> Should I include those in the template?
```

### Collaborative Problem Solving

For complex challenges, Assistant can engage in deep problem-solving dialogue:

```bash
# Start a problem-solving session
assistant solve

> What challenge would you like to work through together?

# Describe the challenge
> We need to migrate from MongoDB to PostgreSQL but maintain 
> real-time change feeds that downstream services depend on

> This is an interesting challenge. Let me understand the full context:
>
> 1. How many downstream services consume these change feeds?
> 2. What's the approximate data volume and change frequency?
> 3. Are there specific MongoDB features you're using beyond basic CRUD?
>
> [After gathering information...]
>
> I suggest a phased approach using PostgreSQL's LISTEN/NOTIFY with 
> logical replication. Here's how we can maintain compatibility:
>
> 1. Implement a change data capture layer using PostgreSQL triggers
> 2. Create a compatibility adapter that translates PostgreSQL 
>    notifications to MongoDB change stream format
> 3. Use transactional outbox pattern for guaranteed delivery
>
> I can generate a proof of concept that demonstrates this approach
> with your actual schema. Would that be helpful?
```
