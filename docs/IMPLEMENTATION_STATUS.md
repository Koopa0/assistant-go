# Implementation Status

## Overview
This document tracks the current implementation status of various features in the Assistant Go project, including what's completed, what's in progress, and what's still TODO or mocked.

## Streaming Functionality Status

### ✅ Completed
- **Stream Architecture**: Full streaming pipeline from AI Service → Processor → CLI/WebSocket
- **Channel-based Streaming**: Implemented with text, event, error, and done channels
- **CLI Integration**: CLI checks for `EnableStreaming` config and uses streaming methods
- **WebSocket Support**: Complete WebSocket endpoint for streaming responses
- **Stream Processor**: Handles chunking and buffering of responses

### ⚠️ Partially Implemented
- **AI Streaming**: Currently **simulated** - the AI service fetches the complete response first, then breaks it into chunks
  - Claude: `streamFromClaude` calls regular `GenerateResponse` then chunks the result
  - Gemini: `streamFromGemini` calls regular `GenerateResponse` then chunks the result
  - **Reason**: Waiting for official streaming support in Claude/Gemini Go SDKs

### ❌ Known Issues
1. **No Real Streaming**: Responses are fetched completely before streaming starts
2. **Demo Mode**: When using mock database and test API keys, responses are empty
3. **Direct Query Command**: Fixed - now uses streaming (`assistant ask` command)

## Mock Implementations

### Database
- `MockClient` in `/internal/platform/storage/postgres/mock_client.go`
- Returns hardcoded values like "mock-value-0", "mock-value-1"
- Used when `ASSISTANT_DEMO_MODE=true` or no database URL provided

### AI Responses in Demo Mode
- With invalid API keys, AI service returns errors
- Mock client doesn't simulate AI responses

## TODO Items

### High Priority
1. **Real AI Streaming**: Implement when SDKs support it
   - Monitor Claude SDK for streaming support
   - Monitor Gemini SDK for streaming support

2. **System Prompts**: Currently set to `nil` in streaming
   - Need to implement `buildSystemPrompt` based on context

3. **Workspace Detection**: Currently returns hardcoded values
   - Implement real Git repository detection
   - Detect project type from files
   - Get actual project path from environment

### Medium Priority
1. **Memory System Integration**: Currently returns empty/mock data
   - Implement actual memory retrieval
   - Track conversation topics
   - Store user preferences

2. **Configuration**:
   - Make embedding cache size/TTL configurable
   - Make conversation history limit configurable
   - Add streaming delay configuration

3. **Statistics Tracking**:
   - Implement real request counting
   - Track success/failure rates
   - Measure actual processing times

### Low Priority
1. **Tool Detection**: Currently hardcoded list
   - Dynamically detect available tools
   - Check tool health before listing

2. **Version Information**:
   - Get version from build info
   - Track actual uptime
   - Show Git commit hash

## Testing Streaming

### With Real API Key
```bash
# This will show real streaming (but still simulated chunking)
CLAUDE_API_KEY=your-real-key assistant ask "Explain Go channels"
```

### In Demo Mode
```bash
# This will fail with API key error
ASSISTANT_DEMO_MODE=true assistant ask "Hello"
```

### CLI Interactive Mode
```bash
# Start CLI with streaming enabled
assistant cli
# Then type your queries
```

## Configuration Requirements

### For Real Streaming Experience
1. Valid Claude or Gemini API key
2. PostgreSQL database (or use demo mode)
3. Streaming enabled in config:
   ```yaml
   cli:
     enable_streaming: true
   ```

## Future Improvements

1. **Native Streaming**: Replace simulated streaming when SDKs support it
2. **Streaming Metrics**: Add metrics for chunk size, frequency, latency
3. **Adaptive Chunking**: Adjust chunk size based on network conditions
4. **Stream Resumption**: Handle interrupted streams gracefully
5. **Compression**: Optional response compression for large outputs

## Development Notes

- Streaming delay is hardcoded to 20ms between chunks
- Chunk size is 5 words or at punctuation marks
- Buffer size is 100 for streaming channels
- WebSocket timeout is 60 seconds
